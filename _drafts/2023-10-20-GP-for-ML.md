## Intuition 
For most ML model, input -> **single number** of prediction. 
But, GP model, input -> **certainty** of prediction 

So, model is: produce prior samples of functions, before observing data 

prior samples (model) + data --Bayes Theorem--> Posterior samples 

When dealing with machine learning problems, we can have two approaches: 
- assumption of **one** kind of the function: e.g., linear 
  
&rarr; problems: richness of functions 
- give prior porbability of **every possible functions**, and higher probability for more likely functions 
  
&rarr; problems: uncountably inf possible functions 

&rarr; solution: Gaussian Process
