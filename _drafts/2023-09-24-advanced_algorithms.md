This post provides a [cheatsheet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pdf/Algorithms CSCI3160 review.pdf %}) for the CSCI3160 course at CUHK, a course I found particularly engaging. It primarily focuses on advanced algorithms. Feel free to explore.


At the moment, it's in a handwritten format.I plan to organize and proofread in the near future.
